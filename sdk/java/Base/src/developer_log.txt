Changes to version 1.03

- the push/onPush operations were modified to allow for results to be returned

Component's management

A component may be in one of the following states:
INIT 		- the initial component 
CREATED 	- the created component after initialization is performed
READY 		- the component is started and is ready to process information
RUNNING 	- the is currently running

A component will call the following functions 
INIT 		=> onCreate() 					=> CREATED
CREATED  	=> onStart() 					=> READY
READY		=> prior to call to doInput()	=> RUNNING			
RUNNING		=> completion of doInput()		=> READY


Clarified how push works:
Push will succeed when there is enough data to save on the port. The buffers on the input ports are useful in that data is available
on multiple ports.


Programmer's guide
If your component cannot handle pushes at any point within its execution, add a queue to buffer its inputs
